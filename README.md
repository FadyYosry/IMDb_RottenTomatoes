# Film Data Scraping from IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes Websites

### Project Overview

This project involves scraping film data from either IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes websites. The process is initiated by a user prompt where they select the website they wish to search on and then input the film name. The data retrieved varies slightly depending on the chosen website:

#### IMDb

- Film name
- Duration
- Year of production
- Rating

#### Rotten Tomatoes

- Film name
- Duration
- Year of production
- Tomato meter score
- Audience score

After retrieving the data, the user is prompted whether to continue or not. If the choice is not to continue, all the collected data is saved in a file named "AllData.txt".

This project facilitates the efficient gathering of film information from popular movie databases, enhancing the user's ability to access relevant data quickly and conveniently.
